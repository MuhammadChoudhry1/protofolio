      desc: 'The finance app was developed using a full-stack architecture with React Native and Expo for the cross-platform frontend and Flask (Python) for the backend. The app used Azure Data Studio with SQL Server (via Docker) for structured, relational data storage after migrating from MongoDB. The backend integrates JWT for secure authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and Flask-CORS for cross-origin communication. For data analytics and machine learning, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor) were used to predict future savings. Visualizations were implemented using react-native-chart-kit and react-native-progress (including Pie, Line, and Bar charts), replacing Power BI due to macOS limitations. HTTP requests were handled using Axios, and AsyncStorage managed secure token storage on the frontend. Additional tools included Google OAuth 2.0, Google SMTP for email features, and Expo Notifications for alerts. The project followed an Agile Iterative Development approach with version control through GitHub.',

      name: 'TripAdvisor Reviews Using LSTM and CNN-Based Deep Neural Networks',
      desc: 'The sentiment classification project was developed using Python 3.12, leveraging deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to build and train two distinct models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Text preprocessing was carried out using NLTK for tasks such as punctuation removal, stopword filtering, tokenization, and padding. The neural models utilized Keras Embedding layer to convert text into dense 128-dimensional vectors. The LSTM architecture focused on capturing temporal dependencies using gated units, while the CNN architecture extracted local semantic features via 1D convolutional layers and pooling. Training was performed on a stratified 60/40 split with Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy as the loss function. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed using Scikit-learn. The CNN model outperformed LSTM in generalization and class balance. Deployment was designed using a predict_sentiment() function, ready for integration with frameworks like Flask or FastAPI, supporting real-time inference in microservice architectures.',
